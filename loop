Python has two primitive loop commands:

while loops
for loops


A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  
  With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items.
  
Python while loop is used to run a specific code until a certain condition is met.
while condition:
    # body of while loop
