Python List Data Type
List is an ordered collection of similar or different types of items separated by commas and enclosed within brackets [ ]. For example,

languages = ["Swift", "Java", "Python"]

Python Tuple Data Type
Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified

String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes. For example,

name = 'Python'
print(name)  

message = 'Python for beginners'
print(message)

Python Set Data Type
Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by commas inside braces { }. For example,

# create a set named student_id
student_id = {112, 114, 116, 118, 115}

# display student_id elements
print(student_id)

# display type of student_id
print(type(student_id))

Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value pairs.

-keys are unique identifiers that are associated with each value.

# dictionary named capital_city
capital_city = {'Nepal': 'Kathmandu', 'Italy': 'Rome', 'England': 'London'}

print(capital_city)
